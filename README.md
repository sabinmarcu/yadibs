## YADIBS
#### Yet Another Deployment Integrated Build System

**`YADIBS`** is a Node.JS based development system, in essence. 
Through its modular construction, it allows developers to create separate compilers and middleware that turn a 
complex task such as **bundling a whole application** in different pre-compiled packages together with all dependencies
and much more, and linking it with both *RESTful APIs* and *WebSocket APIs*, all while keeping a well-thought and
rigurous structure, and testing the living **`$!&%`** out of it.
